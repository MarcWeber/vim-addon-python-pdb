installation:
=============

  get github.com/MarcWeber/vim-addon-manager, and add 'vim-addon-rdebug' to the
  list of plugins to be activated on startup. Read its documention.
  It also talks about alternative and references Vim's help file about what the
  old way of installing plugins was.

  use any other way and install this plugin along with the plugins mentioned in
  the dependency section of ./addon-info.json (which all can be found on
  github.com/MarcWeber).


BUGS:
    - setting breakpoints is supported, but updating them clears all of them.
